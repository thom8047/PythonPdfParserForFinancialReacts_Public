# Python Pdf Parser For FinancialReacts Application

Pythons scripts for *[Financial Reacts](https://github.com/thom8047/FinancialReacts_v1.0.0)*. This code has since been deprecated, mainly because Well's Fargo continuously changed how the PDF's were written and so I had to change this code every month to stay current.
